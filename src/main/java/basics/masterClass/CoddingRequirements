Area Calculator
Write a method named area with one double parameter named radius.

The method needs to return a double value that represents the area of a circle.

If the parameter radius is negative then return -1.0 to represent an invalid value.

Write another overloaded method with 2 parameters x and y (both doubles), where x and y represent the sides of a rectangle.

The method needs to return an area of a rectangle.

If either or both parameters is/are a negative return -1.0 to indicate an invalid value.

For formulas and PI value please check the tips below.

Examples of input/output:

area(5.0); should return 78.53975

area(-1);  should return -1 since the parameter is negative

area(5.0, 4.0); should return 20.0 (5 * 4 = 20)

area(-1.0, 4.0);  should return -1 since first the parameter is negative





TIP: ​The formula for calculating the area of a rectangle is x * y.

TIP: ​The formula for calculating a circle area is radius * radius * PI.

TIP: For PI use a constant from Math class e.g. Math.PI

NOTE: All methods need to be defined as public static ​like we have been doing so far in the course.

NOTE: Do not add a main method to your solution code!



Minutes To Years and Days Calculator
Write a method printYearsAndDays with parameter of type long named minutes.

The method should not return anything (void) and it needs to calculate the years and days from the minutes parameter.

If the parameter is less than 0, print text "Invalid Value".

Otherwise, if the parameter is valid then it needs to print a message in the format "XX min = YY y and ZZ d".

XX represents the original value minutes.
YY represents the calculated years.
ZZ represents the calculated days.



EXAMPLES OF INPUT/OUTPUT:

printYearsAndDays(525600);  → should print "525600 min = 1 y and 0 d"

printYearsAndDays(1051200); → should print "1051200 min = 2 y and 0 d"

printYearsAndDays(561600);  → should print "561600 min = 1 y and 25 d"



TIPS:

Be extra careful about spaces in the printed message.

Use the remainder operator

1 hour = 60 minutes

1 day = 24 hours

1 year = 365 days

NOTES

 The printYearsAndDays method needs to be defined as public static ​like we have been doing so far in the course.

 Do not add main method to solution code.

The solution will not be accepted if there are extra spaces

Equality Printer
Write a method printEqual with 3 parameters of type int. The method should not return anything (void).

If one of the parameters is less than 0, print text "Invalid Value".

If all numbers are equal print text "All numbers are equal"

If all numbers are different print text "All numbers are different".

Otherwise, print "Neither all are equal or different".



EXAMPLES OF INPUT/OUTPUT:

printEqual(1, 1, 1); should print text All numbers are equal

printEqual(1, 1, 2); should print text Neither all are equal or different

printEqual(-1, -1, -1); should print text Invalid Value

printEqual(1, 2, 3); should print text All numbers are different



TIP: Be extremely careful about spaces in the printed message.



NOTES

The solution will not be accepted if there are extra spaces.

The method printEqual needs to be defined as public static ​like we have been doing so far in the course.

Do not add main method to solution code.


Playing Cat
The cats spend most of the day playing. In particular, they play if the temperature is between 25 and 35 (inclusive). Unless it is summer, then the upper limit is 45 (inclusive) instead of 35.



Write a method isCatPlaying that has 2 parameters. Method needs to return true if the cat is playing, otherwise return false

1st parameter should be of type boolean and be named summer it represents if it is summer.
2nd parameter represents the temperature and is of type int with the name temperature.



EXAMPLES OF INPUT/OUTPUT:

isCatPlaying(true, 10); should return false since temperature is not in range 25 - 45

isCatPlaying(false, 36); should return false since temperature is not in range 25 - 35 (summer parameter is false)

isCatPlaying(false, 35); should return true since temperature is in range 25 - 35



NOTES

The isCatPlaying method needs to be defined as public static ​like we have been doing so far in the course.

Do not add the main method to the solution code.

Number In Word
Write a method called printNumberInWord. The method has one parameter number which is the whole number. The method needs to print "ZERO", "ONE", "TWO", ... "NINE", "OTHER" if the int parameter number is 0, 1, 2, .... 9 or other for any other number including negative numbers. You can use if-else statement or switch statement whatever is easier for you.



NOTE: Method printNumberInWord needs to be public static for now, we are only using static methods.

NOTE: Do not add main method to solution code.
