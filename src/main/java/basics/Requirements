BeautifulSwaps

Whenever George asks Lily to hang out, she's busy doing homework. George wants to help her finish it faster,
but he's in over his head! Can you help George understand Lily's homework so she can hang out with him?

Consider an array of "n" distinct integers,arr=[a[0],a[1],a[2],..a[n--1] . George can swap any two elements of
the array any number of times.
An array is beautiful if the sum of [arr[i]--arr[i--1] among 0<i<n is minimal.

Given the array , determine and return the minimum number of swaps that should be performed in order to make
the array beautiful.

Example
arr=[7, 15, 12, 3]

One minimal array is [3, 7, 12, 15] . To get there, George performed the following swaps:
     [3, 7, 12, 15]
3,7  [3, 15, 12, 7]
7,15 [3, 7, 12, 15]

It took  swaps to make the array beautiful. This is minimal among the choices of beautiful arrays possible.

Returns

int: the minimum number of swaps required:

Example
Input:
STDIN       Function
-----       --------
4           arr[]size n = 4
2 5 3 1     arr = [2, 5, 3, 1]

Output:
2
